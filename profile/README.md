## Universal Linux Installer
> **Project in development**

ULI (Universal Linux Installer) is a software inspired on msi, and .exe installers from Microsoft Windows.
The idea behind is to offer a friendly use to new Linux users to install .deb, .rpm. .AppImage, .flatpak applications.
Experienced users can feel more "productive" in the sense of just double-clicking and install.
